<p>During the 1920s there was a radical shift in German sans serif letterforms. A marriage between the precise geometry of earlier German sans serifs with the clean legibility of the humanists coming out of England, yielded a geometric sans serif that is so iconic that it still looks as futuristic and forward-thinking as it did almost 100 years ago. Jost* is an ode to this era of type design. Instead of trying to recreate it precisely, Jost* aims to capture the spirit, using the technologies of today.</p>

<p>Jost* has 9 weights, ranging from Hairline to Black. It can support many languages, includes stylistic alternatives, and both tabular and proportional numbers. Using Jost* on the web is as easy as copying a line of code into your webpage and includes automatic updates. As of version 3.0, Jost* supports OpenType Variable Font technology that allows users to control the exact weight and italic of the font. Best of all Jost* is still being actively developed meaning it will continue to improve and future updates may include features requested by you! <a href="http://indestructibletype.com/Jost">Visit the website for more information!</a></p>
